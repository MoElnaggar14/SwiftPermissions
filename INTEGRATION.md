# Permissions Package Integration Guide

## Overview

The Permissions package has been successfully integrated into the NusukIslamicApp_iOS project, replacing the existing location manager with a comprehensive permissions system.

## What's Been Done

### 1. Created Comprehensive Permissions Package (`/Packages/Permissions/`)

- **Modern API**: Built with async/await and Combine for reactive programming
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Supports 15+ permission types including Location, Notifications, Camera, Microphone, Photo Library, Contacts, etc.
- **SwiftUI Integration**: Ready-to-use view modifiers and components
- **Protocol-Based Design**: Easily mockable for testing
- **iOS 16+ Support**: Takes advantage of the latest iOS features

### 2. Replaced LocationManager with LocationService

**Old Implementation** (`LocationManager.swift` - REMOVED):
- Basic CLLocationManager wrapper
- Manual permission handling
- Callback-based API

**New Implementation** (`LocationService.swift`):
- Uses Permissions package for permission management
- Async/await API
- Comprehensive error handling
- Protocol-based design for testability

### 3. Updated PrayerTimes Module

- Updated `PrayerTimesViewModel` to use new `LocationService`
- Added Permissions dependency to PrayerTimes target
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing prayer time functionality
- Enhanced error handling for location requests

### 4. Created UI Components

#### LocationPermissionView
- Enhanced location indicator with permission status
- Tap to request permissions
- Visual feedback for different permission states
- Automatic permission status updates

#### PermissionsSetupView
- Complete onboarding flow for app permissions
- Step-by-step permission requests
- Beautiful UI with progress indicators
- Configurable permission steps

#### PermissionsEntry
- Public API for accessing permission-related views
- Simple factory methods for common use cases

### 5. Package.swift Updates

- Added Permissions package dependency
- Updated PrayerTimes target to include Permissions
- Added FaithHome target dependency on Permissions
- Fixed typo in package reference (`Permissons` → `Permissions`)

## How to Use

### 1. Basic Permission Checking

```swift
import Permissions

// Check status
let status = await PermissionManager.shared.status(for: .locationWhenInUse)

// Request permission
let result = await PermissionManager.shared.request(.locationWhenInUse)
if result.isSuccess {
    // Permission granted
}
```

### 2. SwiftUI Integration

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Permissions

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("My Islamic App")
        }
        .conditionalOnPermission(.locationWhenInUse) {
            // Show when location authorized
            LocationBasedContent()
        } notAuthorized: {
            // Show when location not authorized
            LocationPermissionPrompt()
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Onboarding Setup

```swift
import FaithHome

struct OnboardingView: View {
    var body: some View {
        PermissionsEntry.getPermissionsSetupView {
            // Called when setup is complete
            print("Permissions configured!")
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Permission Dashboard

```swift
// Show all permissions
PermissionsEntry.getPermissionsDashboardView()

// Show specific permissions
PermissionsEntry.getPermissionsDashboardView(
    permissions: [.locationWhenInUse, .notification, .camera]
)
```

## Features

### ✅ Location Services
- When in use and always authorization
- Automatic reverse geocoding
- Permission status monitoring

### ✅ Push Notifications
- Standard and provisional authorization
- Custom notification settings

### ✅ Camera & Microphone
- Video and audio capture permissions
- Media access management

### ✅ Photo Library
- Read and write access
- Limited photo access support

### ✅ Contacts & Calendar
- Contact book access
- Calendar and reminders integration

### ✅ Advanced Permissions
- Health data (extensible)
- Motion & fitness
- Biometric authentication
- App tracking transparency

## Testing

The package includes a mock implementation for testing:

```swift
import Permissions

class MyTestCase: XCTestCase {
    func testPermissions() async {
        let mockManager = PermissionManagerFactory.mock()
        
        if let mock = mockManager as? MockPermissionManager {
            mock.setShouldGrantPermissions(true)
        }
        
        let result = await mockManager.request(.camera)
        XCTAssertTrue(result.isSuccess)
    }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the integration**: Build and run the app to ensure everything works correctly
2. **Add to onboarding**: Use `PermissionsSetupView` in your app's onboarding flow
3. **Enhance UI**: Consider using `LocationPermissionView` in prayer times display
4. **Add more permissions**: Extend for camera access (for QR codes), microphone (for voice features), etc.
5. **Customize**: Modify the permission setup flow to match your app's branding

## Info.plist Requirements

Make sure these usage descriptions are added to your app's Info.plist:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to show accurate prayer times for your area.</string>

<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need your location to provide prayer time notifications and location-based Islamic content.</string>

<key>UNUserNotificationCenterDelegateEnabled</key>
<true/>

<!-- Add other permissions as needed -->
```

## Summary

The Permissions package provides a robust, modern solution for permission management in your Islamic app. It replaces the old location manager with a comprehensive system that can handle all iOS permissions in a consistent, user-friendly way.

The integration maintains all existing functionality while providing a foundation for enhanced permission management and better user experience.
